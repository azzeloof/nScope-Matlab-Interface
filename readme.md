This project is a Matlab app designed to interface with a nScope USB oscilloscope.
It requires the nScopeAPI, which can be found at https://github.com/nLabs-nScope/nScopeAPI.
To use this app, clone the API, and add ../matlab to your Matlab path. After that, the app
should run.

Note that editing the source requires Matlab 2016, because it was made in the App Designer
tool.

Current version (alpha-0.1) is not suitable for use, as it is missing several important features and is fairly buggy.

Install "nScope Matlab Interface.mlappinstall" in matlab to use.
